# one-touch-windows
Originally developed for the MGF this file allows driver and passenger windows to be operated either as normal or one touch with just a short tap on the switch. 
There is an optional time out function providing power to the system for three minutes after the ignition is switched off and another which
uses the superlocking function to operate the rollup of both windows.
